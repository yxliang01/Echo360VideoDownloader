### Version 2.2.0 - June 26, 2016

- **All UI** - Added new setting `silent` to all modules which allows you to disable all console output including errors. This can be useful for preventing known errors, like a popup which cannot place itself on screen, or `sticky` content which initializes before it is visible [#3713](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3713)
- **Popup** - Added new `tooltip` popup type that works without javascript. Tooltips can specify positioning and some variations using `data` attributes, and will handle positioning automatically with CSS only.
- **Popup** - Added new setting `boundary` and `scrollContext`. `boundary` lets you specify an element that the popup will try to position itself to be contained inside of. `scrollContext` lets you specify the element which when scrolled should hide the popup
- **Popup** - Added new settings `observeChanges`, which is enabled by default. This will add special mutation observers to trigger `destroy` when the element is removed from the document, preventing memory leaks.
- **Popup** - Fixed issue where clicking element inside popup removed from DOM (like clicking a multi select label) would cause popup to close [#3887](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3887)
- **Popup** - checking `instanceof SVGGraphicsElement` caused error in IE11 [#3043](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3043)

### Version 2.1.7 - Dec 19, 2015

- **Popup** - Adds `onUnplaceable` callback when element cannot be placed in visible screen [#3388](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3388)
- **Popup** - Fixed `is visible`, `is animating`, and `is fluid` to always return `true/false` and not the DOM element. [#2781](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2781)
- **Popup** - Fixed issue with `onEnable` callback being defined with name `onEnabled` and `onDisable` with `onDisabled` in default settings, causing an error. To preserve backwards compatibility, the misspelled callback name has been left, but the bug has been fixed. [#3148](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3148)

### Version 2.1.5 - Nov 1, 2015

- **Popup** Added three new variables for `arrow` background color based on position, top, center or bottom. This makes it easier to use gradient backgrounds with popups and still match arrow colors.
- **Popup** - Added behaviors `get popup` and `change content` to more easily determine popup from activating element and change text
- **Popup** - Fixes positioning issue when `movePopup: false` [#3213](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3213) **Thanks @parisholley**
- **Popup** - Popup now works with `svg` elements [#3043](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3043)

### Version 2.0.4 - July 17, 2015

- **Popup** - Fixed issues where rounding could cause elements that are against edge of page from not appearing. Add new `jitter` setting for allowing popups to escape page boundaries by a small margin [#2526](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2526)
- **Popup** - `wide` and `very wide` popup will now limit themselves to normal popup widths on mobile so that they still appear on screen.

### Version 2.0.3 - July 8, 2015

### Version 2.0.0 - June 30, 2015

- **Popup** - Popup has been rewritten to drastically improve performance, especially when testing multiple positions.
- **Transition** - Fallback javascript animations have been removed from UI components like dropdown and popup to increase performance. This removes need for expensive pseudo selectors like `:visible`, `:animated` and `:hidden` and reduces filesize.

- **Popup** - `onShow` and `onHide` callback can now cancel popup from showing or hiding by returning false
- **Popup** - Added more size variations for popup `mini`, `tiny`
- **Popup** - Popup now correctly adjusts if `data` attributes change

- **Popup** - Popup will no longer appear incorrectly if the targeted element is not visible on page
- **Popup** - Fixed bug which could cause pre-existing inline popup to be removed from DOM after hiding
- **Popup** - Fixes popup offstage position calculations with pages including horizontal scrollbars

- **Popup** - Popups will now by default appear over all UI content, even dimmers.

### Version 1.7.0 - January 14, 2015

- **Popup** - Popup now uses its own custom method for determining `offsetParent` meaning 3D contexts (like inside an animation) no longer should break positioning
- **Popup** - Popup now uses `preserve: false` by default, this is slightly less performant but will reduce page clutter caused by leaving generated elements in the DOM
- **Popup** - `wide` and `very wide` popup will now appear when screen size is below their `max-width`
- **Popup** - Popup no longer blurs element on popup hide

- **Popup** - Popup can now use a setting ``lastResort``. When set to a position it will be used as a last resort even if popup does not entirely fit on the page. Setting this to ``false`` will produce an error when a popup cannot fit on screen.
